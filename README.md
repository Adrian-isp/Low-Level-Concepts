# Learning Systems Programming Languages
## Notes of concepts in **asm, C and C++** as I learn how to program

I made this repository in January 2025. Initially I just wanted to put some
C++ ideas, but eventually I embarked on a journey to dimistify how my
computer worked.

I started taking notes while learning the **C** language, already knowing some basic programming in **C++** *(that is i/o, arrays, conditionals, loops and functions)* 

I find it useful to have a remote respository of concepts that I can reference
and also track my progress.

# C
I decided it would be better to go lower level and start learning
the C language, as it is used in so many domains as well as products
we use daily, such as embedded systems, operating systems and even
interpreters for other languages like Python.

I followed an online tutorial from Bro Code which taught me the basics of:
- Input/output in C
- Data types
- Strings
- Enums
- Typedef
- Bitwise operators
- Memory addresses and pointers
- Reading and writing files

# asm (x86)
As I wanted to understand computers I tried to learn about computer architecture
from the ground up just to get an idea of how things work. I followed Crash 
Course computer science videos, which led me to assembly.

I used **GCC** to compile C and C++ files into assembly.
