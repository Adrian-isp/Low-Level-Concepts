# Learning C and C++

I made this repository in January 2025 to store some C++ 
programming ideas, but eventually I started a journey to deepen my 
understanding of how computers and software work.

I started taking notes while learning the **C** language, already knowing
the basics of **C++** *(that is: i/o, arrays, conditionals, loops and functions)* 

I find it useful to have a respository of concepts that I can reference
to track my progress.
