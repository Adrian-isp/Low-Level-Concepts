# Learning C and C++

I made this repository in January 2025 to store some C++ 
programming ideas, but eventually I started a journey to deepen my 
understanding of how computers and software work.

I started taking notes while learning the **C** language, already knowing
the basics of **C++** *(that is: i/o, arrays, conditionals, loops and functions)* 

I find it useful to have a remote respository of concepts that I can reference
and also track my progress.

## Updates

#### C++
- Namespaces - Mar-11
- Constructors - Mar-10
- Exception handling keywords - Mar-10
- Manual memory allocation(new/delete) - Mar-04
- Classes - Mar-04

#### 1st of March:

- Managed to use cmake to link two c files using headers!
- Recently been focusing on small ASCII graphics projects

#### 18th of February:
More about C:

- how pointers and arrays relate
- pointer arithmetic
- header files
- make files automating gcc scripts

I had to mess with the gcc compiler since I don't use visual studio, 
but learned more this way and it was worth it

### Computers & assembly language
#### 15th-16th of February 2025

As I wanted to understand computers I tried to learn about computer architecture
from the ground up just to get an idea of how things work. I went through the
[Crash Course Computer Science](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8dPuuaLjXtNlUrzyH5r6jN9ulIgZBpdo&si=lNaGR6sSJz-Innin) series, which led me to assembly.

I used **GCC** to compile some simple C and C++ files into assembly. 
I found trying to understand every instruction to be quite a hassle, 
and I can't say I made any program in assembly from scratch, but I 
at least learned quite a bit about the cpu and how programs operate:

- memory registers
- what constant variables do
- the difference between local and global variables
- what the stack is
- how conditionals, loops and functions use jump instructions
- roughly how C can map to assembly and cpu instructions

### C
#### 4th of February

I decided it would be better to go lower level and start learning
the C language, as it is used in so many domains as well as products
we use daily, such as embedded systems, operating systems and even
interpreters for other languages like Python.

I followed a [C tutorial video](https://youtu.be/87SH2Cn0s9A?si=LxIadvo_bsFoAonx)
which taught me the basics of:
- Input/output in C
- Data types
- Strings
- Enums
- Typedef
