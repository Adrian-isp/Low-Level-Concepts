# Learning Systems Programming Languages
## Notes of concepts in **asm, C and C++** as I learn how to program

I decided to take notes while learning the C language, 
while already knowing the basics of C++.
I find it useful to have a remote respository of concepts I can reference.

# C
I decided it would be better to go lower level and start learning
the C language, as it is used in so many domains as well as products
we use daily, such as embedded systems, operating systems and even
interpreters for other languages like Python.

I followed an online tutorial from Bro Code which taught me the basics of:
- Input/output in C
- Strings
- Enums
- Bitwise operators
- Memory addresses and pointers
- Reading and writing files
